This project was my first attempt to get into the Ruby on Rails universe. I literaly had no idea of what is Ruby or/and why Rails is glued with the Ruby in such a way. I stil dont know the entire universe of web applications.

The main objective here is to learn a framework that leave decisons free of dependency over projects that can diverge in concept. What I learn until now show me that the Rails comunity is one of the most consistent in how the things need to be. Of course that THIS APPLICATION IS FOR LEARNING PURPOUSE ONLY, and I believe that it will be kept as is for many time, because I need to learn the server side of the Rails world.

This code was generated/guided by the User Guide from Rails website https://guides.rubyonrails.org/ plus the amazing full course of the Free Code Camp in youtube https://youtu.be/fmyvWz5TUWg?si=h3CdP2XXbiKj6su7. Everything was done based on this two sources, and after that I dove into the GoRails youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@GorailsTV), where Chris and another guys went so deep in a steep learning path. There are many other sources needed to cover all the knowledge in such a way anyone can get pro in this fantastic world.

Well... I hope be here as soon as possible to evolve this project and deploy this blog to production. 

* Ruby version: 3.2.2
